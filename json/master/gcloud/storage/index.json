  "description": "\n Shortcut methods for getting set up with Google Cloud Storage.\n You'll typically use these to get started with the API:\n >>> from gcloud import storage >>> client = storage.Client() >>> bucket = client.get_bucket('bucket-id-here') >>> # Then do other things... >>> blob = bucket.get_blob('/remote/path/to/file.txt') >>> print blob.download_as_string() >>> blob.upload_from_string('New contents!') >>> blob2 = bucket.blob('/remote/path/storage.txt') >>> blob2.upload_from_filename(filename='/local/path.txt')\n The main concepts with this API are:\n - <a data-custom-type=\"gcloud/storage/connection/connection\">gcloud.storage.connection.Connection</a> which represents a connection between your machine and the Cloud Storage API.\n - <a data-custom-type=\"gcloud/storage/bucket/bucket\">gcloud.storage.bucket.Bucket</a> which represents a particular bucket (akin to a mounted disk on a computer).\n - <a data-custom-type=\"gcloud/storage/blob/blob\">gcloud.storage.blob.Blob</a> which represents a pointer to a particular entity in Cloud Storage (akin to a file path on a remote machine).",
