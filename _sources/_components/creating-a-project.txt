* **Create a project**

  Start off by visiting https://cloud.google.com/console
  and click on the big red button
  that says "Create Project".

* **Choose a name**

  In the box that says "name",
  choose something friendly.
  This is going to be the *human-readable* name
  for your project.

* **Choose an ID**

  In the box that says "ID",
  choose something unique
  (hyphens are OK).
  I typically choose a project name
  that starts with my initials,
  then a hyphen,
  then a unique identifier for the work I'm doing.
  For this example,
  you might choose ``<initials>-quickstart``.

Then click OK
(give it a second to create your project).
